1. Inserted UoM Mapping pcs -> PC

-> @Tatjana: Bugfix requested

2. 4 Distributor IDs have thrown a warning, because they are not represented in the manufacturer excel 

Warning: "WARNING: No BSH Supplier found for this Distributor: 473326_ODM-GB0006"

Distributor_ID
GB0006
AT0046
DE0817
DE0304

-> TODO: Need to be added to manufacturer excel with respective values; Distributor_name is missing @Lutz, Sercan

Warning disappears at second run and distributors got imported correctly
For now: Run the import script twice

-> @Tatjana: Bugfix requested

3. To be discussed: Quantity=0 for PCBs in BOM -> How do we handle this? Is it an error? @Kathrin, Lutz
Solution: 
- For now insert distribution/direct instead of distributor name
- When distributor names/IDs are clarified, insert values to TC
